Pub-sub infrastructure, with clustering, comet-based real-time event delivery to browsers integrated with data change notifications allows you to build interactive but scalable push-style applications. Persevere's comet framework, Tunguska, provides a robust publish-subscribe hub designed for distribution across multiple machines. Persevere cohesively combines pub-sub message delegation with data stores for change notifications, making it easy to provide web-based real-time views of data (data retrieval + subscription to changes), as well as build other channels of message delivery like chat and ad-hoc notification that integrate with the data model.

Persevere makes efficiently use of non-blocking IO to create scalable comet applications. Persevere includes options for various configurations including cross-domain communication and streaming or long-polling based interaction.
